Ittamma took out her first $45 loan four years ago and used it to cultivate her family’s land.   With subsequent loans, she bought banana plants and started a banana plantation, harvested and sold her bananas and earned $1,100 which she used to rebuild her house and leased additional acres.   She paid off the debts and freed her family from bonded labor.
